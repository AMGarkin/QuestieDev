-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v2.5:
* Moved all Questie settings to a "per-character" setup so each character
  will have their own settings. This was necessary since most of the new
  options are more or less a Per-Character preference rather than a global
  one. This also allows Questie to hook and save QuestTracker data between
  characters and sessions. This also reduces installation/reinstallation
  issues since you'll only have to clear character saved data rather than
  remembering to clear both character and global data.

* Fixed a crashing issue while dragging the QuestTracker with new installs,
  reinstalls and new characters. Upon first login there is no SavedVariables
  file. I've inserted a temporary config that will be loaded into memory to
  hold all the initial settings so Questie will have someplace to store the
  screen coordinates when a user moves the QuestTracker to their preferred
  position. Once you logout or reload your UI these settings and your Saved
  Variables file is created in your characters SavedVariables folder. This
  should also resolve some issues with folks not able to move the Quest
  Tracker. Please remember that you must move your mouse pointer over the
  QuestTracker before you hold down the Ctrl+Shift keys, then push and hold
  down your left mouse button while you drag the QuestTracker to the desired
  location on your screen.

* Fixed an issue with the Worldmap for those not running Cartographer or
  Metamap. The Worldmap was assigned a FrameStrata that was too low so 
  some of the Default UI elements were appearing on top of the Worldmap.
  I've moved the FrameStrata to a higher level and it now appears above all
  elements. Please let me know if you're still seeing issues in v2.5 and
  I'll bump it another layer.

* Fixed an issue with the QuestTracker disappearing in an instance. I
  tracked down the root cause in Astrolabe and added an additional map
  check. Basically it wasn't finding map coordinates while the map frame
  was closed. Everything appeared normal as long as the map was open.
  Well, that's not very practical when running an instance! So I forced
  the check to assume it's always in an instance unless it can get a set
  of coordinates other than 0,0. This bug was exposed while working on
  a new feature/improvement for Questie - below.

* Quests that are untracked from the QuestTracker will also remove the
  objective notes from the Minimap and Worldmaps! I'm not entirely sure 
  if this was an issue before but at one point while working on this new
  feature, every available quest your character could get appeared on the
  Minimap. Unless, you're in the zone it won't show on your Minimap
  anymore. This is also true for objectives. However, available quests
  and objectives will continue to show on your Worldmap no matter which
  zone you’re in. This should help reduce the clutter in the Minimap that
  was driving me nuts!

* Last but not least... COLORS! Yes, there is a new set of QuestTracker
  colors you can choose from. Use /questie boldcolor to flip the color
  scheme. The idea was requested by a user on GitHub. They wanted to make
  the QuestTracker resemble MonkeyQuest's color scheme. Well now it does.
  Quest levels are based on your level - as always and quest titles are now
  White. Objectives begin Red then fade to Yellow then finally to Green. The
  QuestArrow has also been changed to match. By default, the old color scheme
  is enabled.
 
 * More code clean up.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v2.4:
* Added an "Elite" tag to the QuestTracker - Elite quests will now 
  properly carry the [+] along with the quest level tag.

* Added a minlevel/maxlevel filter along with an on/off toggle
    - /questie minlevel - toggles the filter on or off
    - /questie maxlevel - toggles the filter on or off

    - /questie setminlevel <%number%> - accepts a number argument 
      this will filter/notshow quests <x> levels BELOW your current 
      level. - Default=6
    - /questie setmaxlevel <%number%> - accepts a number argument this
      will filter/notshow quests until <x> levels ABOVE your current 
      level. - Default=3

    - These toggles/filters are independent of each other. Either one 
      can be enabled or disabled in any combination.

* Modified the QuestTracker/QuestArrow dragging Key Modifiers from 
  Shift+MouseButtonDown to CTRL+Shift+MouseButtonDown - there are too 
  many key combos in WoW that use the Shift key so I thought it safer to
  include an additional key combo. Might resovle a crashing issue 
  someone reported.

* I fixed the abandon quest bug where the icon was not showing back up 
  on the world/minimaps.

* Due to the number of improvements that Questie has undergone these past
  several weeks, the Toggle Questie button on the Worldmap is no longer 
  needed. If you need to toggle the icons use /questie mapaids.

* Code clean up

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v2.3:
* Added a SHIFT key modifier to the QuestTracker and QuestArrow - unless 
the shift key is down, you can't drag it.

* Wardz's commit fixing/preventing the QuestTracker from being dragged
off screen was also applied to the QuestArrow.

* Added Enable/Disable toggles for
    - Worldmap/Minimap icons (/questie mapaids)
    - QuestArrow (/questie arrow)

* Added Bronze Feather to the Winfury Matriarch drop table for the quest 
Preparation for Ceremony reported by PierrickGT.

* Added a small Worldmap modifier for those not running a Mapmod like
Cartographer or MetaMap. This allows the user to see the chat output
and allows the Popup dialog to appear so they can select a quest step
to manually complete.

* I discovered a typo in the code pertaining to EQL3. This fix now allows
the user to untrack a quest from their QuestTracker with or without EQL3.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v2.2:
* A bug was reported on the Nostalrius forums - there was some frame code
that was creating double popups preventing new one's from appearing
properly. Fixed.

* During my debug I found another bug in the "refresh code" that caused
Questie to disable itself in certain situations. Fixed.

* I added a 10 sec timeout to the popup dialog in case it doesn't appear
on a users screen to handle poorly coded evil add-on's that might
prevent it from being displayed properly. Grrrrrr.... - A fail safe of
sorts.

* Updated TOC to reflect new version

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v2.1:
* Improved the WorldMap Quest tool tips by adding Quest Level, Quest
Started by, Quest Finished by and an OnClick usage note for manually
finishing quests.

* Added an OnClick function to manually finish quests via the WorldMap
along with an Auto-Toggle routine that refreshes the map and makes the
icon instantly disappear upon manual completion.

* For quest chains with more than one step I added a Popup Dialog that
accepts user input so they can select which step to complete. Quest
chain steps are still reported via the chat window since the popup only
accepts two button inputs or an edit box.
