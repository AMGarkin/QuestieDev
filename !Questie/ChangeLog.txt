v2.4:
* Added an "Elite" tag to the QuestTracker - Elite quests will now 
  properly carry the [+] along with the quest level tag.

* Added a minlevel/maxlevel filter along with an on/off toggle
    - /questie minlevel - toggles the filter on or off
    - /questie maxlevel - toggles the filter on or off

    - /questie setminlevel <%number%> - accepts a number argument 
      this will filter/notshow quests <x> levels BELOW your current 
      level. - Default=6
    - /questie setmaxlevel <%number%> - accepts a number argument this
      will filter/notshow quests until <x> levels ABOVE your current 
      level. - Default=3

    - These toggles/filters are independent of each other. Either one 
      can be enabled or disabled in any combination.

* Modified the QuestTracker/QuestArrow dragging Key Modifiers from 
  Shift+MouseButtonDown to CTRL+Shift+MouseButtonDown - there are too 
  many key combos in WoW that use the Shift key so I thought it safer to
  include an additional key combo. Might resovle a crashing issue 
  someone reported.

* I fixed the abandon quest bug where the icon was not showing back up 
  on the world/minimaps.

* Due to the number of improvements that Questie has undergone these past
  several weeks, the Toggle Questie button on the Worldmap is no longer 
  needed. If you need to toggle the icons use /questie mapaids.

* Code clean up

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v2.3:
* Added a SHIFT key modifier to the QuestTracker and QuestArrow - unless 
the shift key is down, you can't drag it.

* Wardz's commit fixing/preventing the QuestTracker from being dragged
off screen was also applied to the QuestArrow.

* Added Enable/Disable toggles for
    - Worldmap/Minimap icons (/questie mapaids)
    - QuestArrow (/questie arrow)

* Added Bronze Feather to the Winfury Matriarch drop table for the quest 
Preparation for Ceremony reported by PierrickGT.

* Added a small Worldmap modifier for those not running a Mapmod like
Cartographer or MetaMap. This allows the user to see the chat output
and allows the Popup dialog to appear so they can select a quest step
to manually complete.

* I discovered a typo in the code pertaining to EQL3. This fix now allows
the user to untrack a quest from their QuestTracker with or without EQL3.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v2.2:
* A bug was reported on the Nostalrius forums - there was some frame code
that was creating double popups preventing new one's from appearing
properly. Fixed.

* During my debug I found another bug in the "refresh code" that caused
Questie to disable itself in certain situations. Fixed.

* I added a 10 sec timeout to the popup dialog in case it doesn't appear
on a users screen to handle poorly coded evil add-on's that might
prevent it from being displayed properly. Grrrrrr.... - A fail safe of
sorts.

* Updated TOC to reflect new version

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v2.1:
* Improved the WorldMap Quest tool tips by adding Quest Level, Quest
Started by, Quest Finished by and an OnClick usage note for manually
finishing quests.

* Added an OnClick function to manually finish quests via the WorldMap
along with an Auto-Toggle routine that refreshes the map and makes the
icon instantly disappear upon manual completion.

* For quest chains with more than one step I added a Popup Dialog that
accepts user input so they can select which step to complete. Quest
chain steps are still reported via the chat window since the popup only
accepts two button inputs or an edit box.
