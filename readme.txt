This will be expanded in the future and differes from the readme.md in that it will be included
in every release, with information specific to how to install.


Currently known major issues:
 - Sometimes notes/objectives might not show on the map due to a desync issue.
      An easy fix for this is clicking "Toggle Questie" in the world map twice,
	  or typing "/reloadui"



Basic install instructions
 - Extract the archive
 - Copy the "!Questie" folder into your "<WOW FOLDER>/Interface/Addons/" directory
      * NOTE * It should be beside several folders that start with "Blizzard_"
 - Log into the game and verify Questie is loaded by going into the addon menu (Bottom left of the screen)
      * NOTE * It is recommended that you increase the addon memory limit (top right of the window)
	             The default value for vanilla is very low and may cause problems if you use questie with other addons
