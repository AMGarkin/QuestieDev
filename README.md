# Questie
After weeks of additional development, Questie v1.0 is finally out, lots has changed since the last version, so much that the original post and youtube video is no longer accurate.

Currenly, Questie uses Cartographer for world map waypoints, and it's own internal minimap system to display waypoints on the minimap. It makes use of some data dumped from the 2.4.3 QuestHelper, and some data scraped from various vanilla wowhead clones. All the development is public and available on github, and any bug reports or contributions there are more than welcome!

*Notes:*
- Please use the <a href="https://github.com/AeroScripts/QuestieDev/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a> to report bugs (link at the bottom)
- A tutorial on how to submit buglogs (for bugged quests) to us will be on wiki (GitHub) soon
- Cartographer by default enables non-fullscreen world map, and automatically reveals the full map even if you haven't explored it, to disable this:
Fullscreen: click Cartographer on the world map -> look and feel -> enable/disable
Reveal all: click Cartographer on the world map -> foglight -> enable/disable

Here are some example images of what Questie can do:
